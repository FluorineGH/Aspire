Aspire Space Game

This is a simple space game created to learn graphics and game making in Java.

I also learned to do animations, pause and quit keys, and add sounds to the game.

It still needs work, as while the pause key Z stops the action, you can still shoot, etc.

I will probably not continue development of this game unless I get bored or need to show someone something.
